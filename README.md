# Entropy_Csio_fxCG-50
Python code for entropy calculation on Casio fx-CG50 calculator (version 3.80.02.12). Simple, efficient, and insightful.

Features:

  •calculate_entropy(probabilities):
        Function that takes a list of probabilities and calculates entropy using the Shannon formula.

  • menu():
        Function that displays a simple menu with the following options:
            Insert probabilities
            Calculate entropy
            Exit

Usage:

The program prompts the user to enter the number of events, their names, and respective probabilities. It then allows the user to calculate entropy based on these probabilities. The result is displayed along with the list of events and their associated probabilities.
Menu (Translated to English):

  •Insert probabilities
  •Calculate entropy
  •Exit

Example of Execution:

  •Choose "1" to insert probabilities.
  •Enter the number of events, names, and probabilities.
  •Choose "2" to calculate entropy based on the inserted probabilities.
  •Choose "3" to exit the program.

This code can be used as a foundation for understanding how to calculate entropy and can be enhanced to meet different requirements or integrated into larger projects.

Note: This code is compiled for a Casio fx-CG50 calculator with the updated version 3.80.02.12
